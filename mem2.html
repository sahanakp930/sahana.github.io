<p>2.What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth</p>
  <p><strong>Ans:</br>Space Efficiency:</strong>It Refers to amount memory (or storage) an algorithm uses during its execution.
</br><strong>Example:</strong> An algorithm that requires less RAM is more space-efficient.</br><strong> Time Efficiency:</strong>It Refers to how much time an algorithm takes to solve a problem as the input size increases.</br><strong>Example:</strong>
An algorithm that runs faster as data grows is time-efficient.</br></br><strong>Why are They Important?</strong></br></br>
<strong>Limited resourses:</strong></br>Many systems have constraints on available memory.
</br><strong>Performance:</strong></br>Efficient memory usage improves overall execution speed.
</br><strong>Scalability:</strong></br>Algorithms with lower space requirements can handle larger input sizes.
</br><strong>Cost effectivenes:</strong></br>Reducing memory usage reduces operational costs in data centres.
</br><strong>Orders of growth:</strong>
</br><strong>1.Constant space(O(1)):</strong>Uses fixed amount of memory regardless of input size.Ex:swapping two variables or finding the sum of an array without storing intermediate results.
</br><strong>2.Logarithmic space(O(logn)):</strong>Memory usage grows logarithmically with the input size.Ex:Recursive algorithms with logarithmic hight,like binary search.
</br><strong>3.Linear Space(O(n)):</strong>Memory usage grows linearly with input size.Ex:storing an input array.
</br><strong>4.Quadratic space(O(n^2)):</strong>Memory usage grows quadratically with the input size.Ex:Storing a graph adjacency matrix for n nodes.
</br><strong>5.Exponential space(O(2^n))</strong>Memory usage grows exponentially with the input size.Ex:Storing all subsets of a set in brute-force solutions.
</br><strong>6.Factorial space(O(n!)):</strong>memory usage grows as a factorial of input size.Ex:Generating all permutations of n elements.

<p>3.Take away from different design principles from chapter 2</p>
 <p>In creating a hash table we need to choose a data structure that supports fast indexing and efficient handling of collision.We need to use a simple yet effective algorithm to generate hash values.We need to use well designed hash function that is less prone to collisions.</p>

<p>4.The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)</p>
  <p><strong>Ans:</br></strong><strong>Hierarchical Data & Tree Data Structures</br></strong>
  Hierarchical data shows parent-child relationships and can be effectively represented using tree data structures. These trees have special properties that make operations faster, depending on their type and purpose.
</br></br>
<strong>General Tree:</br></strong>A tree can be expressed in binaey ternary and n-ary forms,but expressing in those forms created confusions in naming them like 1st left,second left,1st right, or something other therefore expressing binary tree is more efficient.
<strong>Binary Search tree:</br><strong>In binary search tree we will move the child which is less the parent to the left and child which is larger than the parent to the right.The inorder traversal of the BST always gives the numbers in sorted order.Binary search tree can create skewed trees. 
<strong>2-3 Tree:</br></strong>In order to balance binary search tree we moved to the notation of introducing more than one item in a node,however this could still introduce the skeweness in the tree hence we next go for AVL-tree.
</br></br>
<strong>Red-Black Tree:</br></strong>A Red-Black Tree is another type of self-balancing binary search tree. It uses a color system (red or black) to quickly balance itself, requiring fewer adjustments than AVL trees. It works efficiently for tasks like database indexing and managing ordered data.
</br></br>
<strong>2-3 Tree:</br></strong>A 2-3 tree is a balanced tree where each node can have two or three children. It is great for database indexing and supports efficient searching and inserting with a time complexity of O(log n). It's an alternative to B-Trees for managing ordered datasets.
<strong>AVL-tree:</strong>AVL tree is balancing the BST by rotating the unbalanced part.It can be single rotation or double rotation.
 <strong>Red black tree:</strong>In order to reduce the number of rotations we resort to red black tree.
</br></br><strong>Heap:</br></strong>A heap is a type of tree that maintains a property where the largest or smallest value is always at the root. Heaps are used in priority queues, scheduling tasks, and sorting. They allow fast access to the maximum or minimum value in O(1) time and insertion or deletion in O(log n).
</br></br><strong>Trie:</br></strong>A Trie, or prefix tree, is a tree optimized for storing and searching strings. Each branch represents a single character, which makes prefix-based lookups very fast. They're commonly used in features like autocomplete, dictionary lookups, or routing. However, they use a lot of memory for very large datasets.

<p>5.The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed</p>
 <p><strong>Ans:</br></strong><strong>The Need for Array Query Algorithms:</br></strong>
 Array query algorithms are designed to efficiently answer questions about data stored in arrays, such as retrieving specific values, computing aggregates (e.g., sum, maximum, minimum), or updating values under constraints. As arrays are a fundamental data structure, these algorithms are crucial for optimizing performance in various scenarios.
</br></br>
<strong>Principles of Array Query Algorithms:</br></strong>
Array query algorithms are based on a few key ideas:</br>
<strong>1.Preprocessing:</strong>Transform the array or compute auxiliary data to enable faster queries (e.g., prefix sums, sparse tables).</br>
<strong>2.Divide and Conquer:</strong>Divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine results (e.g., segment trees).</br>
<strong>3.Divide and Conquer:</br></strong>Breaking problems into smaller parts to solve them faster.</br>
<strong>4.Efficient Memory Use:</strong>Ensuring the algorithms use minimal memory while working quickly.</br></br>
<strong>Applications:</br></strong>Array query algorithms are used in many areas. They help search and sort data quickly in databases, make fast decisions in real-time systems like traffic and stock trading, and power search engines to find web information quickly. They also make it easier to study large data in big data and help predict things like weather or science models. These algorithms make handling data faster and simpler.</br>
<strong>Implications:</br></strong>Using the right array query algorithms makes data operations faster and helps systems run smoothly. Using the wrong methods can slow everything down. These algorithms are important for handling large amounts of data quickly and keeping systems working well. In short, they make searching and managing data faster in real-life situations.</br></br></p>

<p>6.Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each</p>
<p><strong>Ans:</br>Difference Between Trees and Graphs:</br></strong>A tree is acyclic and connected whereas a graph is cyclic or acyclic,connected or disconnected.In trees there are n-1 edges for n nodes whereas in graphs the number of edges varies and there is no specific formula for that.
</br></br><strong>Traversals:</br></strong>
In trees, we can visit nodes in different orders:</br>
</br></br><strong>DEPTH FIRST SEARCH:</br></strong>
<strong>Preorder: </strong>Visit the node first, then its left and right children.Example: Used in expression trees to generate prefix expressions.</br>
<strong>Inorder: </strong>Visit the left child, then the node, then the right child (used for sorting in binary search trees).</br>
<strong>Postorder:</br></strong> Visit left and right children, then the node.Example: Used in expression trees to generate postfix expressions</br>
<strong>Level-order:</br></strong> Visit nodes one level at a time.</br>   In graphs we use BFS and DFS traversals.</br>Trees are great for organizing data. For example, binary search trees make searching and inserting data fast. Heaps are used for sorting and managing priorities, and tries are useful for things like autocomplete and dictionaries. Trees also represent family trees and file systems.
Graphs are better for showing complex connections. They are used in social networks to show friendships, in maps to find routes, in web crawling to explore the internet, and in electric circuits to show how parts are connected.
In simple terms, trees are best for simple structures, and graphs are used for complicated connections.</p>

<p>7.Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and they connect to real world</p>
<p><strong>Ans:</br>Sorting Algorithms:</br></strong>Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order, like smallest to largest (ascending) or vice versa (descending). These methods make data easier to search, analyze, or use in other processes.
</br><strong>Techniques Behind Sorting:</br></strong></br>
<strong>1.Bubble Sort: </strong>Compares and swaps adjacent elements until the entire list is sorted. Simple but slow for large data.</br>
<strong>2.Selection Sort: </strong>Finds the smallest (or largest) element and places it in the correct position, repeating for all elements.</br>
<strong>3.Merge Sort: </strong>Divides the data into smaller parts, sorts them, and then merges them back together. Very fast for large data.</br>
<strong>4.Quick Sort: </strong>Picks a "pivot," divides the data into smaller or larger groups, and sorts them. Efficient for most cases.</br>
<strong>5.Heap Sort: </strong>Uses a heap structure to sort data. Good for large datasets.</br></br>
<strong>Real-World Use of Sorting:</br></strong>
Sorting is used everywhere! For example:</br>
-Organizing files or emails by name or date.</br>
-Displaying products on e-commerce sites by price or popularity.
-Preparing data for analysis in spreadsheets or databases.</p>

<p>8.Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths</p>
<p><strong>Ans:</br>Importance of Graph Algorithms:</br></strong>Graph algorithms are crucial for solving real-world problems that involve networks, connections, or relationships. Two key areas where graph algorithms are highly important are spanning trees and shortest paths.</br>
<strong>Spanning Trees:</br></strong>A spanning tree is a subgraph of a graph that includes all its nodes but only enough edges to form a tree (no cycles). The most common type is the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), which minimizes the total weight of the edges.</br></br>
<strong>Why spanning trees are important..?</br></strong>Spanning trees are vital in network design, helping to create efficient communication or electrical networks at minimal cost, such as laying cables for internet or electricity while avoiding unnecessary expenses. They also aid in optimization by reducing redundant connections while ensuring the network remains fully operational. Additionally, spanning trees are used in clustering for machine learning and data analysis to group related data points effectively.</br>
<strong>Shortest Paths:</br></strong>Shortest path algorithms find the smallest possible distance or cost between two nodes in a graph. Examples include Dijkstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm.</br>
<strong>Why shortest paths are important..?</strong></br>Shortest path algorithms are vital for navigation systems to find the fastest routes, network routing for efficient data flow, transportation to optimize deliveries and schedules, and game development for pathfinding in characters or objects.
</br><strong>Real-World Impact:</br></strong>Graph algorithms for spanning trees and shortest paths are essential in areas like transportation, communication, logistics, and even gaming. They provide efficient ways to design networks, reduce costs, and optimize processes, making them critical for modern technology and infrastructure.</br></br>
</p>

<p>9.Discuss about the different studied algorithm design techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Ans:Divide and Conquer</br></strong>Divide and conquer breaks a problem into smaller parts, solves each part, and combines the results. Algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search use this method for efficient sorting and searching, making it ideal for data processing and computational tasks.</br>
<strong>Dynamic Programming :</br></strong>Dynamic programming solves overlapping subproblems and stores results to avoid repetition. It is used in algorithms like Matrix Chain Multiplication and Optimal Binary Search Tree, helping with optimization in resource allocation and scheduling.</br>
<strong>Greedy algorithm:</br></strong>Greedy algorithms make the best immediate choices to find an overall solution. They are used in Kruskal’s and Prim’s for minimum spanning trees and Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest paths, helping with network design and resource management.</br>
<strong>Backtracking:</br></strong>Backtracking explores all possible solutions, undoing steps when constraints are violated. It solves problems like N-Queens and is useful for puzzles, combinatorial problems, and constraint-based tasks like solving mazes.</br>
