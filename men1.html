<p><strong>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: <a href="https://github.com/sahanakp930/sahana.github.io/edit/main/mem1.html">Link to details</a></p>

<p><strong>Recursion:</strong></p>
<p>Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It continues breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems until it reaches a base case, which stops the recursion.</p>

<p><strong>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth.</strong></p>
