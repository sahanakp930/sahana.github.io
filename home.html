<h2>Home page Introduction</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Intoduction of course:</strong>It is a branch of Computer science that involves in creating of efficient algorithms to solve problems.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Course about:</strong>The course is about to find efficient algorithms to solve the problems in terms of space and time complexity.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong>:Data structures are Arrays,Linked list,Stacks,Queues,Trees,Graphs,Heap and Algorithms are Sorting,Searching,Recursion,Backtracking,BFS,DFS,Dijkstra,Floyd_Warshall,Kruskal's,Prim's.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Connect course with real time applications:</strong> Yes we have connected course with real time applications.example:On solving Invitation problem to find shortest route, we can connected various algorithms like Dijkstra, kruskal's
  also In Divide and Conquer: search the engines like google use divide and conquer techniques(quicksort,mergesort) to process and sort large amount of data efficiency.
