        <h2>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Path finding: Bees and ants find optimal paths to food sources, resembling shortest path algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> Animals migrate and make decisions based on resource availability similar to decision tree algorithm.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Trial-and-error processes like ants finding food or birds building nests.</li>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the amount of memory (or storage) an algorithm uses during its execution. Example: An algorithm that requires less RAM is more space-efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Refers to how much time an algorithm takes to solve a problem as the input size increases. Example: An algorithm that runs faster as data grows is time-efficient.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
        <h2>Why are They Important?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Efficient algorithms save memory and time, which is crucial for limited resources in real-world systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> With increasing input sizes, efficient algorithms ensure performance doesnâ€™t degrade.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Applications:</strong> Faster, efficient solutions are vital in applications like GPS, healthcare, AI, and large-scale data processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Different Classes of Problems</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Computational Problems:</strong> Problems requiring algorithms for problem-solving (sorting, searching).</li>
            <li><strong>Optimization Problems:</strong> Finding the best solution out of many possibilities (shortest path, resource allocation).</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Problems:</strong> Determining whether a given condition is true or false for a problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Search Problems:</strong> Locating specific information from a large dataset (like finding a word in a dictionary).</li>

        <h2>4. The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)</h2>
        <h3>Ans:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Data & Tree Data Structures</strong></li>
            <li>Hierarchical data shows parent-child relationships and can be effectively represented using tree data structures. These trees have special properties that make operations faster, depending on their type and purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>General Tree:</strong> A binary search tree (BST) is a special kind of binary tree where the left child is smaller, and the right child is greater than the parent. It allows efficient searching and inserting with an average time of O(log n). But if it gets unbalanced, performance can drop to O(n).</li>
            <li><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> An AVL Tree is a balanced version of a binary search tree. It keeps itself balanced by ensuring a strict condition at every node. Because of this, operations like searching, inserting, and deleting have a guaranteed time of O(log n), even in the worst case. It's ideal for real-time systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A Red-Black Tree is another type of self-balancing binary search tree. It uses a color system (red or black) to quickly balance itself, requiring fewer adjustments than AVL trees. It works efficiently for tasks like database indexing and managing ordered data.</li>
            <li><strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> A 2-3 tree is a balanced tree where each node can have two or three children. It is great for database indexing and supports efficient searching and inserting with a time complexity of O(log n). It's an alternative to B-Trees for managing ordered datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Heap:</strong> A heap is a type of tree that maintains a property where the largest or smallest value is always at the root. Heaps are used in priority queues, scheduling tasks, and sorting. They allow fast access to the maximum or minimum value in O(1) time and insertion or deletion in O(log n).</li>
            <li><strong>Trie:</strong> A Trie, or prefix tree, is a tree optimized for storing and searching strings. Each branch represents a single character, which makes prefix-based lookups very fast. They're commonly used in features like autocomplete, dictionary lookups, or routing. However, they use a lot of memory for very large datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Choosing the Right Tree:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trie:</strong> Best for autocomplete or prefix-based searches.</li>
                <li><strong>Heap:</strong> Great for priority queues or task scheduling.</li>
                <li><strong>AVL Tree or Red-Black Tree:</strong> Use these for frequent searching and inserting in ordered data.</li>
                <li><strong>General Trees:</strong> Best for situations with simple parent-child relationships that don't need balancing.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>5. The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed</h2>
        <h3>Ans:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Need for Array Query Algorithms:</strong> Array query algorithms help us quickly search, retrieve, and update data in arrays. Arrays store data in consecutive memory spaces, but without efficient algorithms, operations on large arrays can become very slow. These algorithms save time and make data processing faster, especially when dealing with big datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Why We Need Them:</strong> We need array query algorithms because they make data operations much faster. Searching through an unsorted list can take a lot of time, but with optimized algorithms, tasks like searching can be done in much less time. These algorithms are essential for real-time systems, big data, and database searches.</li>
            <li><strong>Principles of Array Query Algorithms:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Efficient Searching:</strong> Instead of checking every item, methods like binary search speed up the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing Data:</strong> Preparing data in a certain way to make future searches faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Breaking problems into smaller parts to solve them faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Memory Use:</strong> Ensuring the algorithms use minimal memory while working quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Array query algorithms are used in many areas. They help search and sort data quickly in databases, make fast decisions in real-time systems like traffic and stock trading, and power search engines to find web information quickly. They also make it easier to study large data in big data and help predict things like weather or science models. These algorithms make handling data faster and simpler.</li>
            <li><strong>Implications:</strong> Using the right array query algorithms makes data operations faster and helps systems run smoothly. Using the wrong methods can slow everything down. These algorithms are important for handling large amounts of data quickly and keeping systems working well. In short, they make searching and managing data faster in real-life situations.</li>

        <h2>6. Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each</h2>
        <h3>Ans:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Difference Between Trees and Graphs:</strong> A tree is a hierarchical structure where each node has a single parent and zero or more children. A graph, on the other hand, is a set of vertices connected by edges, and nodes can have multiple relationships with each other. Trees are a specific kind of graph that doesn't have cycles, while graphs can have cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>Traversals:</strong> Both trees and graphs have various ways to traverse through their elements:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tree Traversals:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Preorder Traversal:</strong> Visit the root, then the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inorder Traversal:</strong> Visit the left subtree, then the root, followed by the right subtree.</li>
                        <li><strong>Postorder Traversal:</strong> Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.</li>
                        <li><strong>Level Order Traversal:</strong> Visit all nodes at each level from top to bottom.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Graph Traversals:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>BFS (Breadth-First Search):</strong> Traverse level by level, starting from the root node.</li>
                        <li><strong>DFS (Depth-First Search):</strong> Explore as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
